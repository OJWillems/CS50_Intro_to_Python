# In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. 
# Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case.

# isupper()	Returns True if all characters in the string are upper case
# join()	Converts the elements of an iterable into a string
# lower()	Converts a string into lower case
# replace()	Returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value
